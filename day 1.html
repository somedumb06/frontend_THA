    <h2>Subject: Devsnest's coding camp</h2>
    <h2>In modern times it is imperative for every student to be aware of the technological changes going around the world and more importantly how are these changes taking place. <br> Devsnest is a community of student mentors and young brilliant minds who have come together to provide the students around the nation a peer to peer platform where they can learn and grow. <br>They are currently organising coding camps in multiple universities and colleges and they want permission to do one in our university too. I think it would be a great opportunity for the students to explore a new field of career. hoping for a positive response.</h2>
    <h2>Yours sincerely <br> Param  Patel <br> student </h2>
